Data: This fictional dataset has been obtained from a Kaggle competition - Tabular Playground Series of July 2022. This dataset is particularly challenging because it is designed for
unsupervised learning with hidden clusters, meaning that we don't have labeled data typically used for supervised learning tasks.

Competition Description: In this challenge, you are given a dataset where each row belongs to a particular cluster. Your job is to predict the cluster each row belongs to. 
You are not given any training data, and you are not told how many clusters are found in the ground truth labels.

I have done EDA and implemented few clustering algorithms to try and observe the inherent grouping in the dataset
